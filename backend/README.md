idea

- agent reads calender in month -> get calender events in current month
- decides if calender is balanced or not based on events -> analyze the events (balanced is equal ammount of recreational events as work/meeintgs)
- if unbalanced, search events that are balanced -> get events
- return events at proposed times -> find time slots in calendar
- go through list of events denying accepting -> create event if accepted
